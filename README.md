> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features

### Elevator pitch

Do you ever start making a recipe and then realize you don't have all the ingredients? Not anymore, with the Meal Planner application. Meal Planner lets you enter recipes, track your ingredients, and plan your meals. The planner tells you if you have enough ingredients to make a recipe, and predicts when ingredients will run out so you know when to go shopping. Users can also share and rate recipes, giving you new ideas for meals.

### Design

Here are images of the different pages on the website.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Eleven HTML pages, shown in the Design section of this README.
- **CSS** - Application styling that uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, displaying other user's recipes, applying prediction logic, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Call to a third party for a recipe. Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - retrieving recipes
    - submitting recipes
    - submitting on hand ingredients
    - submitting planned meals
- **DB/Login** - Store users, recipes, on hand ingredients, planned meals. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't plan meals or submit recipes unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user submits recipes, the recipes are given to all other users.
